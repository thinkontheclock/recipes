#### Ingredients

* 400g spaghetti or linguine
* 400g cherry tomatoes
* the zest of 2 large unwaxed lemons
* 100ml olive oil
* 2 heaped teaspoons sea salt (if you are using fine-grain table salt, add a bit less)
* 1 x 400g bag of kale or spinach
* Parmesan cheese (I use a vegetarian one) (optional)

#### Method:

* Fill and boil a kettle and get all your ingredients and equipment together. You need a large shallow pan with a lid.
* Put the pasta into the pan. 
* Quickly and roughly chop the tomatoes in half and throw them into the pan. 
* Grate in the zest of both of the lemons and add the oil and salt. 
* Add 1 litre of boiling water
* Put a lid on the pan and bring to the boil, then remove the lid and simmer on a high heat for 6 minutes, using a pair of tongs to turn the pasta every 30 seconds or so as it cooks.
* Remove any tough stalks from the kale and shred the leaves. 
* Once the pasta has had 6 minutes, add the shredded kale and continue to cook for a further 2 minutes.
* Once almost all the water has evaporated, take the pan off the heat and divide between four bowls. If you like, top with a little Parmesan.
