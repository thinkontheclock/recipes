# Instructions

1. **Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).** Line a baking sheet (or more as needed) with parchment paper.
2. **Add cauliflower to a mixing bowl and toss** with coconut oil (or water), curry powder, and sea salt. Transfer to baking sheet and roast cauliflower for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and tender.
3. **Prepare dressing** by adding green curry paste, tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, salt, and pepper to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. If needed, thin with water until pourable.
4. **Taste and adjust flavor as needed**, adding more green curry paste for a stronger curry flavor, tahini for greater thickness, lemon juice for acidity, or maple syrup for sweetness.
5. **Assemble salad** by adding lettuce to a serving platter or bowl. Top with lentils, grapes, and cooked cauliflower and serve with dressing. Optional: garnish with fresh cilantro.
6. **Best served fresh.** Store leftovers in airtight container for 3-4 days. Store dressing separately for up to 1 week.
