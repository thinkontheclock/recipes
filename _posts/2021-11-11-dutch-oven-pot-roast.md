#### Ingredients

 1. 1 tablespoon olive oil
 2. 4 to 5 pound blade or chuck beef roast
 3. 6 russet large potatoes washed and kept whole
 4. 1 large sweet potato peeled and sliced into very large chunks
 5. 2 red or white onions quartered
 6. 10 cloves garlic whole
 7. 1/2 cup red wine
 8. 2 cups beef stock
 9. 1 tablespoon thyme I used freeze dried
10. Salt and black pepper

#### Instructions

* Preheat your oven to 325 F.
* Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the roast.
* Add the olive oil to a Dutch oven and start heating to medium-high heat.
* Brown the beef roast on all sides, approximately 1 to 2 minutes per side.
* Place your vegetables around the roast and the garlic on top.
* Combine the beef broth and red wine together. Pour over the top of the roast.
* Sprinkle the thyme over the top.
* Cover and place in the oven.
* Roast in the oven for 4-5 hours or until the meat pulls apart when you take two forks to it. The secret is low heat and slow!
